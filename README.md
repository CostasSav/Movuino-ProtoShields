# Movuino-ProtoShields
Development of shields for prototyping using the Movuino

# MovuinoESP8266.pretty folder
Library folder that contains multiple useful part footprints linked to the ESP8266 but also the ESP32

# MovuinoProtoShield_v1.0 folder
Folder containing the first version of the Movuino ProtoShield. The main file is the MovuinoShieldPrototyping.kicad_pro, 
which is a Kicad project containing the schematics and the pcb of the shield. There is also the GerberFiles folder which 
contains all the drilling/gerber files to manifacture the shield.

# MovuinoProtoShield_v2.0 folder
Folder containing the second version of the Movuino ProtoShield, but also multiple other alternative designs that have not been fully developed yet. 
The main file is the MovuinoProtoShield_v2.0.kicad_pro, which is a Kicad project containing the schematics and the pcb of the shield.
In the file MovuinoProtoShield_versions_multiples.kicad_pro, we have the alternative designs mentionned previously.
There is also the GerberFiles folder which contains all the drilling/gerber files to manifacture the shield.

# part-lib folder
Library folder containing important part footprints used in the development of shields for the Movuino.
Most notably, we have the shield connector (DF12_3.0_-36DP-0.5V_86_ folder)
